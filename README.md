# Complete-CPU---vhdl

A lightweight, modular 32-bit CPU built entirely in VHDL â€” complete with a datapath, control unit, instruction memory, and a custom reset sequence. Designed for simulation and potential FPGA deployment.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project is a complete implementation of a simple RISC-style CPU architecture, created from the ground up using VHDL. It supports a basic instruction set, synchronous reset behavior, and instruction execution via a cleanly wired datapath and control logic.

Perfect for hardware experimentation, simulation, and running custom assembly programs.

## ðŸ§© Components

### âœ… Reset Circuit
A synchronous reset module ensures stable startup by holding the CPU in an initialization state for a fixed number of clock cycles. This allows system signals to stabilize before instruction execution begins.

### âœ… Datapath
Handles the movement and processing of data across registers, the ALU, and memory interfaces. Fully modular and easy to expand.

### âœ… Control Unit
Finite State Machine (FSM)-based controller that manages CPU operation cycle-by-cycle based on opcode decoding.

### âœ… Instruction Memory
Instruction memory is configured via a `.mif` file (Memory Initialization File), which allows easy testing of different programs in simulation.
